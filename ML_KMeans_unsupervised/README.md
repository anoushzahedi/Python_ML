One has been asked to support a team of researchers who have been collecting data about penguins in Antarctica! The data is available in CSV format as penguins.csv [Origin of this data: Data were collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER, a member of the Long Term Ecological Research Network].<br/>
Unfortunately, they have not been able to record the species of penguin, but they know that there are at least three species that are native to the region: Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo. Your task is to apply your data science skills to help them identify groups in the dataset!
