Discount Motors is a used car dealership in the UK. They want to lead the way in used cars. Selling to customers who want the latest and greatest features, without the price tag of a brand new car. The UK Government has now announced that from 2030 all new cars will be required to be zero emissions. Although this won’t impact the used car market, it is expected that buyers will give more consideration to the future value of their cars. And petrol and diesel will likely have a much lower value after 2030.<br/>
Next month, our most experienced sales team member will be retiring. They have been on the team almost since the company was founded. They are incredibly talented at estimating the sales price of cars. We are pretty worried that when they retire, we won’t be able to estimate as well, and that will have a considerable impact on sales. Currently, when a new car comes in, team members take all of the information that usually appears in the advert and give it to the team member. They then estimate the price. We have been testing the team members estimating themselves, but they are always around 30% away from the price we know the car will sell for. Can you help us estimate the price we should list a car for? The team's estimates are always around 30% off; we really want to be within 10% of the price. This will mean we can automate the whole process and be able to sell cars more quickly.
