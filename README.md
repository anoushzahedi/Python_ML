Each project includes the necessary documentation for understanding. <br/>

Each project is located in a separate subfolder, which contains all the necessary data, information, and functions required for that project. <br/>

List of Projects:<br/>

## (1) ML_LogiticRegression_Multiclass
Farmers have various options when it comes to deciding which crop to plant each season. Their primary objective is to maximize crop yield, taking into account various factors. One crucial factor that affects crop growth is the condition of the soil in the field, which can be assessed by measuring basic elements such as nitrogen and potassium levels. In this project, I will build multi-class classification models to predict the type of "crop" and identify the most critical feature for predictive performance.

## (2) ML_KMeans_unsupervised
One has been asked to support a team of researchers who have been collecting data about penguins in Antarctica! The data is available in CSV format as penguins.csv [Origin of this data: Data were collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER, a member of the Long Term Ecological Research Network].<br/>
Unfortunately, they have not been able to record the species of penguin, but they know that there are at least three species that are native to the region: Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo. Your task is to apply your data science skills to help them identify groups in the dataset!

## (3) ML_ensemble_regression
A DVD rental company needs your help! They want to determine how many days a customer will rent a DVD for based on certain features and have approached you for help. They want you to try out some regression models, which will help predict the number of days a customer will rent a DVD for. The company wants a model that yields an MSE of 3 or less on a test set. The model you make will help the company become more efficient in its inventory planning. <br/>
To solve the issue, I utilized RandomForestRegressor, gradient boosting, and adaptive boosting for Ridge models.     

## (4) ML_RandomForest
International Essentials is an international supermarket chain. Shoppers at their supermarkets can sign up for a loyalty program that provides rewards each year to customers based on their spending. The more you spend, the bigger the rewards. The supermarket would like to be able to predict the likely amount customers in the program will spend so that they can estimate the cost of the rewards. This will help them to predict the potential profit at the end of the year. I used RandomForest and GrdientBoosting to solve the task. 

## (5) ML_facial_recognition
You are a member of an elite group of data scientists, specialising in advanced facial recognition technology, this firm is dedicated to identifying and safeguarding prominent individuals from various spheres—ranging from entertainment and sports to politics and philanthropy. The team's mission is to deploy AI-driven solutions that can accurately distinguish between images of notable personalities and the general populace, enhancing the personal security of such high-profile individuals. You're to focus on Arnold Schwarzenegger, a figure whose accomplishments span from bodybuilding champion to Hollywood icon, and from philanthropist to the Governor of California.

## (6) ML_credit_card_approval
Commercial banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report, for example. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming (and time is money!). Luckily, this task can be automated with the power of machine learning and pretty much every commercial bank does so nowadays. In this workbook, you will build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, just like real banks do.
