Different Python projects:

Each project includes the necessary documentation for understanding. 

Each project is located in a separate subfolder, which contains all the necessary data, information, and functions required for that project. 

List of Projects:

(1) Farmers have various options when it comes to deciding which crop to plant each season. Their primary objective is to maximize crop yield, taking into account various factors. One crucial factor that affects crop growth is the condition of the soil in the field, which can be assessed by measuring basic elements such as nitrogen and potassium levels. In this project, I will build multi-class classification models to predict the type of "crop" and identify the single most important feature for predictive performance.
